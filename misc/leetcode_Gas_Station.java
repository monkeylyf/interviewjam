/*Gas_Station
leetcode

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at
station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel
from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty
tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit
once, otherwise return -1.

	 * Key notes:
	 * 1. 'Travel around the circuit once' I think it means visit each node once.
	 * 2. No-brainer solution is try every node as a start point. O(n^2)
	 * 3. I think you can only go clockwise though the question deosn't mention.
	 * 4. We can do O(n).
