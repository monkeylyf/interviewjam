high, low, and closing price) for 5,000 companies, how would you do it? You are
responsible for the development, rollout and ongoing monitoring and maintenance
of the feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would
recommend your approach. The feed is delivered once per trading day in a
comma-separated format via an FTP site. The feed will be used by 1000 daily
