/*A device boots with an empty FIFO queue. In the first 400 ns period after
startup, and in each subsequent 400 ns period, a maximum of 80 words will be
written to the queue. Each write takes 4 ns. A worker thread requires 3 ns to
read a word, and 2 ns to process it before reading the next word. What is the
shortest depth of the FIFO such that no data is lost?*/
