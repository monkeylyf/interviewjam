/*Write an aligned malloc & free function that takes number of bytes and
aligned byte (which is always power of 2)
EXAMPLE
align_malloc (1000,128) will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128
and that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.
aligned_free() will free memory allocated by align_malloc.
