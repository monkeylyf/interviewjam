Different Chrome OS users have different settings for update the OS. Google
Chrome OS group updates the system every week andÂ even more frequently, every
day if any backdoor/0day threat.

How do we design system for that?
*/



/*
1. Create different user groups according to all kinds of user update settings.
   Users set update config to 'i want everything' will automatically get pathed
   every time a patch is available; For other users show a reminder window to
   them.
2. User-end poll update info from where update patches store or Chrome service
   send a notification every time there is a new patch available.
3. If the update patch is large, say hundereds of metabytes, try to send the
   file block by block with peer-to-peer. If the patch is small, say, couple
   of kilobytes, then FTP is fine.
