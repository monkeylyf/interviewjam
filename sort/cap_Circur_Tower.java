/*Circur_Tower
careercup

A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one
anotherâ€™s shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be
both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights
and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the
largest possible number of people in such a tower.
EXAMPLE:
input (ht,wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom:
(56, 90) (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
