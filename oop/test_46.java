/*Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the
other. When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or
both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped. On your turn,
you must capture at least one of your opponentâ€™s pieces	The game ends when either user has
no more valid moves, and the win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. Implement
the object oriented design for Othello*/
