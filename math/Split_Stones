/*Suppose you begin with a pile of n stones and split this pile into n piles
of one stone each. Each time you split a pile of stones into two smaller piles
and you multiply the number of stones in each of the two smaller piles you just
formed, e.g, if these piles have r and s stones in them, respectively, you
write down r * s. Show that no matter how you split the piles, the sum of the
products you write down at each step is a constant.


Answer n * (n - 1) / 2
