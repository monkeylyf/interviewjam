/*There are one hundred closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all one
hundred lockers. Next, he closes every second locker Then he goes to every third locker
and closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed (e.g, he toggles every third
locker)	After his one hundredth pass in the hallway, in which he toggles onlylocker
number one hundred, how many lockers are open?*/
