/*A bunch of men are on an island. A genie comes down and gathers everyone together and
places a magical hat on some peopleâ€™s heads (i e , at least one person has a hat). The
hat is magical: it can be seen by other people, but not by the wearer of the hat himself
To remove the hat, those(and only those who have a hat) must dunk themselves underwater
at exactly midnight. If there are n people and c hats, how long does it take the men to
remove the hats? The men cannot tell each other (in any way) that they have a hat
