/*In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?*/


Solution:
Declaring the constructor private will ensure that no one outside of the class
can directly instantiate the class. In this case, the only way to create an
instance of the class is by providing a static public method, as is done when
using the Factory Method Pattern.
Additionally, because the constructor is private, the class also cannot be
inherited.
