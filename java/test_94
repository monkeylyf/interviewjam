/*What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?*/

Solution:

Final
When applied to a variable (primitive): The value of the variable cannot change.
When applied to a variable (reference): The reference variable cannot point to
any other object on the heap.
When applied to a method: The method cannot be overridden When applied to a
class: The class cannot be subclassed.
Finally
There is an optional finally block after the try block or after the catch
block. Statements in the finally block will always be executed (except if JVM
exits from the try block). The finally block is used to write the clean up
code.
Finalize
This is the method that the JVM runs before running the garbage collector.
