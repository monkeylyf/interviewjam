Find the mistake(s) in the following code:

unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i <= 0; --i)
	printf("%d\n", i);



Condition check (i <= 0) will fail when i is initialized.

unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i)
        printf("%d\n", i);

It's alwayd true that for a unsigned int i>=0; infinite loop error.
