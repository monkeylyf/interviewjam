Given a 2D binary int matrix representing a maze. 1 means it's a wall and you can not
move into that cell and 0 means you can move to that cell.

Assume that you start from (0, 0) and the destination is (n - 1, m - 1). Can you reach to
the destination?

Followup 1:
If you can't, then you are given a hammer that can be used only once to break a wall,
can you reach the destination?

Followup 2:
What if hammer can be used k times, k >= 1
