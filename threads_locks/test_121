/*Suppose we have the following code:

class Foo {
public:
	A(.....); /* If A is called, a new thread will be created and the 
		   * correspoinding function will be executes. */
	B(.....); /* same as above */
	C(.....); /* same as above */
}

Foo f;
f.A(......);
f.B(......);
f.C(......);

Can you design a mechanism to make sure that B is executed after A, and C is
executed after B?

Suppose we have the following code to use class Foo We do not know how the
threads will be scheduled in the OS.
Foo f;
f.A(.....); f.B(.....); f.C(.....);
f.A(.....); f.B(.....); f.C(.....);

Can you design a mechanism to make sure that all the methods will be executed
in sequence?
