"""Closet binary search tree value II
leetcode

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the
BST that are closest to the target.

Note:
Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are
closest to the target.
Follow up:
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime
(where n = total nodes)?
